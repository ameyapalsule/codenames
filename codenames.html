			<h1>Game Overview</h1><p>Spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates know the agents only by their
				codenames.Spymasters take turns giving one-word clues. A clue may relate to multiple words on the table. The field
				operatives try to guess which words their spymaster meant. When a field operative touches a word, the
				spymaster reveals its secret identity. If the field operatives guess correctly, they may continue guessing,
				until they run out of ideas for the given clue or until they hit a wrong person. Then it is the other team's
				turn to give a clue and guess. The first team to contact all their agents wins the game</p>
			<h1>Set Up</h1><p>Players split up into two teams of similar
				size and skill.Each team chooses one player to be
				their spymaster. Both spymasters sit on
				the same side of the table and they should be the only one who can see the game key. The other
				players sit across from their spymasters.
				They are field operatives</p>
			<h1>The Key for Spy-Masters</h1><p>Clicking on "Change to spymaster" reveals the secret key and identities of the cards on the table. Only the spymasters
				should see the key. Don't let the field operatives see it.The key corresponds to the grid on the table. Blue squares correspond to words that Blue Team must
				guess (blue agents). Red squares correspond to words that Red Team must guess (red agents). Pale
				squares are innocent bystanders, and the black square is an assassin who should never be contacted at all!</p>
